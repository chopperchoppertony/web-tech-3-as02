                <p>While past active fire seasons have seen more individual fires — 1989 still holds the record with 10,998 fires — 2023 is notable for the total area burned. The previous record was set in 1995 with 7.1 million hectares burned; so far in 2023, a total of 15.2 million hectares has been burned.</p>
                <p>Warm and dry conditions are like kindling for wildfires. Much of Canada, like the rest of North America, has experienced record heat and drought recently as climate change continues to warm the planet.</p>
                <p>"The fires season is also lasting longer now because of climate change. Spring is coming weeks earlier and fall is coming weeks later. More time for the fires and grasslands to burn," Edward Struzik, a fellow at Queen's Institute for Energy and Environmental Policy at Queen's University in Canada and author of "Dark Days at Noon, The Future of Fire" told CBS News.</p>
                <p>Dry, hot weather also breeds more lightning. In a normal season, half of Canada's wildfires are started by lightning, but those fires account for more than 85% of wildfire destruction. The other half are human-caused.</p>
                <p>What might seem like slight increases in average temperatures have major consequences.</p>
                <p>"Most fires in the boreal forest of northern Canada are started by lightning. A one-degree Celsius increase in temperature amounts to about 12% more lightning. So the warmer it gets as the climate heats up, the more triggers there are for fires to burn," said Struzik. Fires have been human-caused in various ways from discarded cigarette butts to sparks from passing trains.</p>

                <p>Fires in Canada are thought to have started in late April and grew more severe in early May prompting a government response on May 6. Warm and dry conditions, plus severe drought in densely forested areas due to global warming have increased the chances of natural fires in recent years. According to the Canada Drought Monitor, all 10 Canadian provinces are experiencing abnormal dryness, moderate or severe drought.</p>
                <p>These fires have traditionally occurred on the country's west coast, but this spring has seen historic fire numbers on Canada's east coast. The wildfires are concentrated in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and the Northwestern Territories in western Canada; as well as in Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia in eastern Canada, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.</p>
                <p>The smoke from the Canadian wildfires has caused poor air quality in several parts of the U.S.</p>
                <p>Chicago, Milwaukee and Detroit recorded some of the worst air quality in the world on June 27 as wildfire smoke from Quebec seeped into the Midwest.</p>
                <p>Earlier this month, as New York City suffocated under a thick smog that turned the skies orange and shrouded its skyscrapers and the Statue of Liberty, Sen. Chuck Schumer said on the floor of the Senate that climate change was driving the smoke blanketing the Eastern seaboard.</p>
                <p>"These Canadian wildfires are truly unprecedented and we cannot ignore that climate change continues to make these disasters worse," he said. "Warmer temperatures and severe droughts mean forests burn faster, burn hotter and burn bigger, and the warming is happening at a faster pace in countries with higher latitudes. None of this — none of this is coincidence."</p>
